### Rocking with BDD

#### Workshop description

Behavior-Driven Development is a fabulous way to create mature applications. However, it's also often misused and treated as "the better TDD" which is not 100% correct. BDD is much more business-oriented and helps in the whole development process, not only the technical part.

During the workshop, we will together write an application with full BDD approach. Starting from the business value, we will move to the deepest level of implementation and back to the tests. We will use Behat and PHPSpec, the best tools for Story- and SpecBDD. I would also try to convince you, that usage of BDD on any medium or long-term project is always valuable, after all.
